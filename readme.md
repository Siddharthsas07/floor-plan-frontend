Angular js Floor Plan App
=======================

This app is to provide UI for floor-plan-app 
Takes api support from floor-plan-app and displays projects and floorplan as well as allow to create projects and upload floorplans to the S3 repository with Rest API calls.


How to run it:
===============

If you have node installed, you can use 'http-server' repository from npm
Run -
> npm install -g http-server

It installs http-server globally.
Once installed navigate to current project directory and run below command:
> http-server -o index.htm

This opens index.html with local server (localhost -> localhost:8080/index.html#/ or localhost:8081/index.html/)

Another way is to use 'brackets' editor. Download brackets and open folder in it.
Go to index.htm file and click on 'flash' like symbol on top right corner.
